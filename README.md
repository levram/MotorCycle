MotorCycle is a development toolkit for [Google Apps Script](http://code.google.com/intl/hu-HU/googleapps/appsscript/guide.html) written in Javascript.

The main feature is that you can run local scripts from your computer. Yes, in this way, you can use your favorite IDE, SCM, code analysis tool!

Other features are:

* logging
* unit testing with jsUnity
* simple continous integration
* mock object for part of the Calendar API, to run test locally
* extensible event handler for modular scripts
* utility methods

**Warning: it is under heavy development, API is unstable, use on your own risk!**

Why it is called MotorCycle?

* it uses GAS :)
* it isn't foolproof
* it's faster than the common way
